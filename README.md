The code for DESeq went smoothly, although I had to modify some of it because I used different samples.  
I did samples 100-120 on the RNA Seq experiment.  
These samples did not have different tissue sites (They were all "E").  
I performed the differential abundance analysis on the plate column as a result.  
I also had to change the gsub expression since I did not use your code to generate the sample names.  
I used the `RNAseq384_SampleCoding.txt` file as the metdata.

The SCGB code also worked.
